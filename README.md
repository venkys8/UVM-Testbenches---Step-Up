Create TB for various protocol related memories.

Special thanks to @kumarkhandagle & @udemy, this learning has been an a major influence of them, in helping become a better verification engineer over time.

The point of this repo, is to practice coding for standard RTLs, create TB, simulate them on edaplayground.com & eventually upload them here on Github as part of opensource learning & utilisation.
